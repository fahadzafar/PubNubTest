# PubNubTest
A HelloWorld PubNud android project that integrates the API showing how to send and receive bytes. 
The send+retrieval time is plotted using a pie chart. A screenshot of the running application is attached.
I wanted to do a thorough test but you need a paid account if you want to send around 2000Bytes. 
Its a simple implementation to wrap your head around the API and how it can be used for cool real-time applications.
